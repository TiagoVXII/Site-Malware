- Always let factions pass
- Always let SGC pass if they are with a Field marshall+
- Do not let anyone pass without a valid reason unless theyâ€™re a staff member
- SGC Hallway Blockers can override checkpoint if they wish to do so you must give checkpoint control directly to them.
- SGC can set up miniature checkpoints when asked to by The Administrator follow them in the same way these will just be more strict
